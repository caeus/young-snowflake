        I started as the first developer here in Colombia, mainly mantaining a django based ill designed solution. I took the rol to design and implement a new architecture. The current architecture is based on many play framework/scala based services and with extensive use of RabbitMQ and Akka Streams. At the end I got to learn a new language (Scala, which I chose for the new backend implementations), also learnt about Akka, AWS, Redis, RabbitMQ, Kafka, Javascript development (typescript, webpack, React, Vue, etc), and last but not least, I sharpened my knowledge in RESTful architectures which I deeply love.

        I was a victim of the entrepreneurial hype. It was here where I became a fullstack developer and started understanding Restful architectures. Many projects, mainly using Heroku, Play framework (Scala and Java), MongoDB, PostgresSQL, and Android (Java and Kotlin).

        Not proud of what I did here (I'm writing this as of 2017). I considered myself a good developer but was by still very inexpert, to be honest. Good with Java in a very procedural way (full mutability and side effects and those bad things). I worked with EJB and GWT mainly. The projects, in which I worked, were called SIPE (Sistema de Ingresos, y Prestaciones Económicas) and Cajapagos (which I completely developed). They were software for Caja de Seguro Social de Panama.

        I worked here just after I finished college. Extremely inexpert, I didn't even know about Maven; no one there, it seems. JSF was the technology which I was using mainly. About the job itself I've gotta say that it was so well organized that a Junior developer, as I was, didn't have the slightest chance to be creative.
        Then again, this was my first job as developer.
