I was literally sold the idea that it was an amazing platform and I was excited to learn a new language. It was all lies (sorry guys). At the end I proposed an extreme architectural change which is what Undertrail is mainly using right now. At the end I got to learn a new language (Scala, which I chose for the new backend implementations), also learnt about Akka, AWS, Redis, RabbitMQ, Kafka, Javascript development (typescript, webpack, React, Vue, etc), and last but not least, I sharpened my knowledge in RESTful architectures which I deeply love.""": String,
